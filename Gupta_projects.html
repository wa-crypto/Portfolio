        <h5> For an activity to discover the purposes of python and turtle, I created an sketch-a-etch game. I was given no instructions and had to learn how to use python to create a user-friendly game. I thought of using to learn turtle and to create a etch-a-sketch game. This is targeted toward younger audiences, as the game can be made into a snake and apple game or any other type of game.The features in this game cna be changed to create a game that people can enjoy and have fun with in general.While doing this project I faced difficulties with how turtle moves with angles and move increments.I worked on this project with a group of fourth graders and demonstrated to them how turtle works. </h5>
