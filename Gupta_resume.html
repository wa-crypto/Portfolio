    <p>I am proud of being a part of the Engineering Academy in Dublin High, and will continue getting more mentorship and knowledge in the basics of engineering. I have talked to many guest speakers and learned about different careers within software engineering, and I continue to be inspired to learn about engineering as a whole. 
  <br>
  One speaker that I talked to is Aileen Inigeuz, an analytics analyst, who works in Chevron. She works to gather and calculate data, and display it in the most understable method. Aileen has inspired many girls to look into the field of engineering through Techbridge. My key takeaway from Aileen is that I should stay passionate about my career, and try to make as much change as I can from learning. Another important speaker that I have met is Jason Yosinski, a software engineer, who works with ai. He talked about his experience in Cornell university, coding a robotic spider. He talked about the many aspects and factors that machine learning has to deal with. For example, the spider he was trying to work with had many trials and errors that required the spider to learn how to walk. The key takeaway that I learned is that perseverance and patience in engineering will help you get far. 
  <br>
  Another person that is my mentor and a good resource to talk to is my dad. He continuously works hard to keep himself up to date with new technology, when he has been in the software industry for over 20 years. He is a certified aws architect, and has many different certifications. My dad works at RingCentral as the Director of Engineering, and manages a team of 50 people onshore and offshore. He gives me a taste into the work that he does on a daily basis, and provides useful insight.
